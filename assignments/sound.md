# Assignment 8: Sound

**Name your project folder `08_sound`.**

Create a sketch that creates interesting sounds and/or music.

## Requirements
1. There should be at least one sample-based sound. You can find sounds on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) after you've created an account.
1. There must be at least one synth-based sound playing musical notes. These musical notes should be part of a [musical scale](https://github.com/mtreanor/computational-art-spring2024/blob/main/examples/4-8-24/scales.js).
1. Some sounds should be played based on either some sort of user interaction, or as a result of the interaction between the visuals (e.g. play a note when two shapes collide).

## Note
- In order for your samples (sound files) to be played, you will need to upload your sounds to github, and refer to web url, rather than the relative path.
