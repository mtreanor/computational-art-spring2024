# Assignment 8: Sound

**Name your project folder `08_sound`.**

Create a sketch that creates interesting sounds and/or music.

## Requirements
1. There should be at least one sample-based sound. You can find sounds on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) after you've created an account.
1. There must be at least one synth-based sound playing musical notes. These musical notes should be part of a [musical scale](https://github.com/mtreanor/computational-art-spring2024/blob/main/examples/4-8-24/scales.js).
1. Some sounds should be played based on either some sort of user interaction, or as a result of the interaction between the visuals (e.g. play a note when two shapes collide).

## Note
- In class on 4-11-24 I said that in order to get your sounds to work you would need upload the sound to github, and link to it like this:
```
https://YOUR_GIHUB_USERNAME.github.io/computational-art-spring2024/assignments/08_sound/samples/soundFile.wav
```
It turns out it just works with providing relative paths. The reason I thought you had to provide the web link was because of somethign specific to my github setup.

## Turning in your assignment

When you are done, commit and push your changes to your repository in Github Desktop.

If everything worked, you should be able to see your assignment by going to this link:

```
YOUR_GIHUB_USERNAME.github.io/computational-art-spring2024/assignments/08_sound
```

If this doesn't work, take a close look at the [setup assignment](./p5-setup-abstract.html).
