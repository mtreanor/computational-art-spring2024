# Assignment 3: Physics

Now that we are all set up with a basic physics simulation, we can do so much! For this assignment, create a scene that makes creative use of forces and physical simulation. Some ideas might include:

- Launch shapes into "water" (simulating different resistance or 'drag').
    - Can you make a splash?
- Make wacky stuff happen using springs.
    - basic "Soft body" physics
- Combine spirals and physics somehow
- Make dots explode and then return to their starting position

You can pretty much whatever you want, but as a technical requirement, you must make use of forces and have some physics simulation.

Also, try to mostly work within the limitations of what we've covered in class.

## Turning in your assignment

When you are done, commit and push your changes to your repository in Github Desktop.

If everything worked, you should be able to see your assignment by going to this link:

```

```

If this doesn't work, take a close look at the [setup assignment](./p5-setup-abstract.html).
