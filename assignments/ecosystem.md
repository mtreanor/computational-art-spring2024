# Assignment 6: The Ecosystem Project

**Name your project folder `06_ecosystem`.**

Use steering forces to drive the behavior of the creatures in your ecosystem. Here are some possibilities:

- Create schools or flocks of creatures.
- Use a seeking behavior for creatures to search for food (for chasing moving prey, consider pursuit).
- Use a flow field for the ecosystem environment. For example, how does your system behave if the creatures live in a flowing river?
- Build a creature with countless steering behaviors (as many as you can reasonably add). Think about ways to vary the weights of the behaviors so you can dial them up and down, mixing and matching on the fly. How are creaturesâ€™ initial weights set? What rules drive how the weights change over time?
- Complex systems can be nested. Can you design a single creature out of a flock of boids? And can you then make a flock of those creatures?
- Complex systems can have memory (and be adaptive). Can the history of your ecosystem affect the behavior in its current state? (This could be the driving force behind how the creatures adjust their steering force weights.)
