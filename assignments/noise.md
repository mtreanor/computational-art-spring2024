# Assignment 2: Noise

-----------------------

## Turning in your assignment

When you are done, commit and push your changes to your repository in Github Desktop.

If everything worked, you should be able to see your assignment by going to this link:

```
YOUR_GIHUB_USERNAME.github.io/computational-art-spring2024/assignments/02_noise
```

If this doesn't work, take a close look at the [setup assignment]("./p5-setup-abstract.html").
