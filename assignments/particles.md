# Assignment 4: Particle Systems

Create a sketch that makes creative use of at least one particle system. As demonstrated in class, each particle in the system can make use of all the cool physical simulation stuff (e.g. forces, polar coordinates, springs, etc.). Experiment with giving your particles unique properties and behaviors.

Some things you may want to experiment with:

- Simulate smoke/exhaust coming from some device
- Using `map`, change various properties of the particle over its lifetime
- Clouds and rain
- Make the particles seek other entities in the sketch (e.g. ants eating food)
- Make "water" fill a "cup"

## Turning in your assignment

Name your project `04_particles` and place it inside your `assignments` folder.

Your project should be publically viewable by going to this link:

```
YOUR_GIHUB_USERNAME.github.io/computational-art-spring2024/assignments/04_particles
```

If this doesn't work, take a close look at the [setup assignment](./p5-setup-abstract.html).
