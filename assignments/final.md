# Final Project: System Dynamics

**Name your project folder `final`.**

The most interesting and unqiue aspects of computational media result from the surprising and complex interactions between the various aspects of the systems. We've seen this in various examples, such as the vehicle's steering forces being based on the positions of surrounding vehicles, and as a trivial example, having the mouse position influence various aspects of a shape's color or size.

Now that we have covered a wide range of topics, the goal of the final is to create an interesting, and refined, project that intentionally creates complex system dynamics by creating **five** connections between different aspects of the overall system. 

In addition, rather than simply solely making use of the primitive drawing functions as we have for most of the class, you are required to **make use of at least three of the following types of media**: images, audio/music, video, natural language processing/generation, web cams, or something else we haven't covered such as 3D (at your own risk).

As this is the culmination of your semester of work, spend time *refining* what you have made. In other words, are the interesting aspects of your project "legible" (i.e. avoid jumbled chaos). Is there a temporal element to your project (i.e. is there interesting interesting to interact with, or does it evolve over time in interesting ways?). Spend time on color choice. Remember that you can use [color palettes](https://coolors.co/). Spend time to make your shapes, whether meant to represent something or not, look intentional (i.e. don't try to build a cat out of ellipses, unless you are very dedicated, or your project as a consistent "bad art" style - that could be cool).

## Requirements
1. Your project turned in as described below
1. 5+ interconnections between aspects of your system
1. 3+ types of media other than primitive drawing functions
1. README.md file (see below)
1. ***ALL COPIED OR GENERATED CODE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A COMMENT INSIDE YOUR CODE***

## README.md File
In addition to your submission, you must provide a file named `README.md` that provides information about your project. The text in your `README.md` should be written using the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). The following information needs to be included:

1. **TITLE:**A title for your project
1. **LINK:** Your project should be accessible by going to the link referenced in the "Turning in your assignment" section below.
1. **FIVE INTERCONNECTED ASPECTS:** You need to specifically list the five aspects of your system that you made connect to one another. Which one do you tihnk produced the most interesting effect?
1. **MULTIMEDIA:** Specifically point out the three (or more) types of multimedia you used.
1. **ALLOWED TO PUBLICLY SHARE?:** Let me know if you are willing to have me use your project in a public demonstration of student work in DMTI.

## Turning in your assignment

When you are done, commit and push your changes to your repository in Github Desktop.

If everything worked, you should be able to see your assignment by going to this link:

```

```

If this doesn't work, take a close look at the [setup assignment](./p5-setup-abstract.html).
